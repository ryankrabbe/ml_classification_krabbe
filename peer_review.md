### Clarity and Organization
- The project follows the structure outlined in the Midterm Project instructions.
- The format is clear, concise and easy to follow along.
- The README served as a reference with links to the project workbook and peer review.

### Feature Selection & Justification
- Craig chose the features: age, passenger, class and family
- All of the features chosen have a strong impact on surviability and he justified his selection for each feature.
- He specifically noted that he chose these features specifically to drive accuracy in the predictions.

### Model Performance & Comparisons
- Craig used a regression model and a decision tree model to predict survivability.
- The regression model did not perform well as was indicated by a -.01 RÂ² result.
- Although the model did not perform well, he offered reasons as to why he believed it did not perform strongly and it was easy to follow along and understand.
- Craig explained in his next section that the Decision Tree model performed better than the Regression Model, but there wasn't a concrete answer as to why it performed better.
- The results of the Decision Tree model could have been explained better and the data from the model could have been used in a side by side comparision against the Regression Model to clearly show that it did outperform the other model.

### Reflection Quality
- Reflections were well thought out and explained.
- Craig went into detail about how he had some struggles and challenges throughout the project especially related to the code and yielding results with the models.
- In his final thought, he mentioned that he is **convinced** that children has a high factor in survivability, but there is not actual data to back that up, which could potentially lead to some questions
- Overall, Craig did a great job on the project and I thoughourly enjoyed reading through it
