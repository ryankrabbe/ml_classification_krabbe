## Project Outline

### Section 1. Import and Inspect the Data

### Section 2. Data Exploration and Preparation

### Section 3. Feature Selection and Justification

### Section 4. Train a Model (Classification: Choose 1: Decision Tree, Random Forest, Logistic Regression)

### Section 5. Improve the Model or Try Alternates (Implement a Second Option)

### Section 6. Final Thoughts & Insights

## Below is my Summary Table Template
- This template is used to summarize my results across the different models and features used

| Metric       | Decision Tree | Random Forest | Notes |
|--------------|----------------|----------------|-------|
| **Accuracy** | 99.45%         | 99.75%         | Random Forest Model performed slightly better |
| **Precision**| 100.00%        | 100.00%        | Both models were perfect with no false positives |
| **Recall**   | 98.85%         | 99.45%         | The Random Forest Model performed slightly better identifying more poisonous mushrooms |
| **F1 Score** | 99.42%         | 99.72%         | The Random Forest Model's F1 Score was slightly higher, which was a given considering it performed better in every metric |
